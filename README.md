# System Commands.alfredworkflow

![](readme-images/system-commands-alfred-workflow-preview.png)

Alfred doesn't honor the option: [“**Reopen windows when logging back in**”](readme-images/macosx-restart-dialog.png). This workflow gets around it by basically functioning like a macro. So if you see a glimpse of the confirmation dialog before the computer starts to shut down or whatever, that is completely normal.

If needed, hold down `Cmd` when executing the action to stop at the confirmation dialog. You can use this confirmation dialog to change the “**Reopen windows when logging back in**”option without actually shutting down or restarting. `Space` toggles it when the dialog is open.

> The workflow was originally made for Alfred 3, but hsould work in future versions. 

## Before using the workflow

So that you don't accidentally use the wrong commands, you will want to disable all the equivalent commands that come with Alfred at:
`Alfred Preferences > Features > System`

## Default Keywords
* Shutdown
* Restart
* Logout
* Sleep
